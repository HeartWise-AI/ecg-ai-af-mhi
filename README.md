# ECG AI Model Inference

This repository contains Python code for loading ECG (electrocardiogram) data from XML files, preprocessing it, and running inference using a deep learning model. The main functionality is to decode encoded ECG waveforms from XML, transform them to NumPy arrays, and apply a trained model to predict outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- `xmltodict`: For parsing XML files.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations on arrays.
- `tensorflow` (with GPU support if available): For loading and using the deep learning model.
- `tensorflow_addons`: For additional TensorFlow metrics.
- `huggingface_hub`: For downloading models from Hugging Face Hub.

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```shell
pip install xmltodict numpy tensorflow tensorflow_addons huggingface-hub
```

Certainly! Below is a sample README.md file created to explain your code and how to run it. Remember to fill in the sections marked with [...] according to your project's details.

# ECG AI Model Inference

This repository contains Python code for loading ECG (electrocardiogram) data from XML files, preprocessing it, and running inference using a deep learning model. The main functionality is to decode encoded ECG waveforms from XML, transform them to NumPy arrays, and apply a trained model to predict outcomes.

## Prerequisites

- `numpy`: For numerical operations on arrays.
- `tensorflow` (with GPU support if available): For loading and using the deep learning model.
- `tensorflow_addons`: For additional TensorFlow metrics.
- `huggingface_hub`: For downloading models from Hugging Face Hub.

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```shell
pip install xmltodict numpy tensorflow tensorflow_addons huggingface-hub
```

## Structure of the Code
The code is structured into several functions:

decode_ekg_muse_to_array(): Takes base64 encoded waveforms and transforms them into a numeric array.
extract_wf_as_npy(): Extracts waveform data as a NumPy array from a directory containing XML files.
make_inference(): Loads the data, preprocesses it with a standard scaler, and runs the model inference.
get_arguments(): Parses command-line arguments.
How to Run the Code
To run the inference with the ECG AI model, follow these steps:

## Clone this repository.
Place your XML files containing the ECG data in a directory (e.g., ./xml-data/).
Use the following command to run the script. Make sure to replace /path/to/xml_directory with your directory path containing the XML files:

```
python your_script_name.py --xml_dir /path/to/xml_directory
```

The inference results will be printed to the console.

## Downloading the Model
The code is configured to download a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Hub using the snapshot_download function. Ensure you have the proper authentication token to download the model.
